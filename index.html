            <i>
              I am a hard worker and self motivated person.<br>
When I was in college we got permission to celebrate a fresher party.<br>
We are running short of time because of studies, hardly we have to prepare ourselves for Several events.<br>
              I am worried about the party.
At the time i motivated myself and started to think of making an event success.
I take the initiative of this party and I choose my friends who are energetic for the event.<br>
              I assigned different work to my friends , we organised some cultural events and games .<br>
Finally ,the event became a huge success and everyone appreciate us.<br><br>
            I think I do concentrate on one thing at a time and that's why it  becomes a bit difficult to handle other things at the same time for me.So I decided to do multitask also .
Also some one asked me for help i can't say no to them and i end up doing more work.<br>So want change that habit so I can complete my work first and then if I left some time I can utilizes it to help others.<br>
